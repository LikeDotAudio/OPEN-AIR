# A block is an object with three aspects: - It can contain other blocks. - It
# can contain workers. - It can contain agents. - It can contain data networks.
# - It can contain application networks. - It has a signal flow topology. We
# refer to an object inside a block as a **member** of that block. We refer to
# the block which contains an object as the object's **container.1** Normally, a
# block contains a set of members that together function as a processing unit --
# for example, a crossover channel or mixer strip.
