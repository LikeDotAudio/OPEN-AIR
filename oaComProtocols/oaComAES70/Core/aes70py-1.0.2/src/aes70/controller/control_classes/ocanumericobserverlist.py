# Observer of a scalar numeric or boolean property ("target property") of a set
# of specified objects. This class is a subclass of **OcaNumericObserver**, and
# differs from that class only in that it observes a set of properties rather
# than a single property. Does not work for array, list, map, struct, or string
# properties. **OcaNumericObserverList** emits an **Observation** event under
# certain conditions. There are three kinds of conditions:
#
#  - **Numeric comparison**. A target property value meets a certain comparison
#    condition. A selection of comparison operators is available. Such
#    observations are called "asynchronous observations".
#
#  - **Timer expiry**. The value of the** Period** property, if nonzero, is a
#    the time interval for the recurrent timed emission of **Observation**
#    events. Such events ("periodic observations") are emitted regardless of the
#    target property's value.
#
#  - **Combination of (1) and (2)**. If a numeric comparison and a nonzero
#    period are both specified, then the **Observation** event is emitted when
#    the timer expires **and** the numeric comparison is true for at least one
#    of the observed properties. Such observations are called
#    "conditional-periodic observations".
#
#
# This is a weakly typed class. Its threshold is specified as an **OcaFloat64**
# number.
#
#  - For unsigned integer targets, the threshold and target are both coerced to
#    **OcaUint64** before comparing.
#
#  - For signed integer targets, the threshold and target are both coerced to
#    **OcaInt64** before comparing.
#
#  - For boolean values, the threshold hreshold and target are both coerced to
#    **OcaUint8**, True is assigned the value One, False is assigned the value
#    Zero.
#
#
# Note that this coercion may result in rounding errors if the observed datatype
# is of type OcaUint64 or OcaUint64. An **OcaNumericObserver** instance and the
# property it observes are bound at the time the **OcaNumericObserver** instance
# is constructed. For static devices, construction will occur during
# manufacture, or possibly during a subsequent hardware configuration step. For
# reconfigurable devices, construction might be done by online controllers as
# part of device configuration sessions. This class is normally used for
# monitoring readings of sensor readings, but may be used equally well for
# watching workers' parameter settings.
