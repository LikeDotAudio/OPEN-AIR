#     data (dict or any): The data (dictionary or value) to be published.

# 1. Reads the CSV file and calculates summary data (total devices, min/max frequency, span).

# 3. Saves the complete JSON structure to MARKERS.json.
# 4. Publishes the entire JSON structure to MQTT, after purging old data.
