# workers/importers/worker_marker_file_import_converter.py
#
# This file previously contained utility functions for converting various spectrum analyzer
# report formats into a standardized CSV format. These functions have been refactored
# into individual, dedicated worker files within the 'workers/importers/formats' directory.
# This file now serves as a placeholder or could be refactored into a dispatcher
# for the new individual importer workers.
