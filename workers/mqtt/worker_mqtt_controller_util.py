class MqttControllerUtility:
    """
    Placeholder class for MQTT controller utility.
    This class is intended to provide utility functions for MQTT operations.
    Its full implementation would involve methods for publishing, subscribing,
    and managing MQTT connections or topics, likely by coordinating
    with mqtt_connection_manager, mqtt_publisher_service, and mqtt_subscriber_router.
